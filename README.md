# stackline-takehome
A take home assignment for Stackline in Seattle

# Install/run
1. `git clone` using the URL in the repo
2. yarn install
3. yarn dev

# Notes
- Used vite to set up the project
- I used [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for the chart, as it made sense with the time constraints of the assignment, and the final look feels close to the design
- I used [react-data-table-component](https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component) for the table for a similar reason
